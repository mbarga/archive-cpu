# Dual-core R-type Instruction Test Program
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# the following program is fully parallel to be executed in two processors, 
# which does not require a coherence controler but needs a memory arbitrator.
# you can initially use this program to test out your dual pipeline and arbitrator,
# (required by 2nd week's demo)
# then you can change the memory pointers and the stacks 
# to have two programs working on the same piece of memory
# to test out yout coherence controler and snooping  
# feel free to add more instructions and functionalities
# specifcally the ll and sc instructions to test even more. 
# refer to example.asm for a real dual-core program with memory coherence.
